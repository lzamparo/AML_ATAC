Meeting w Eirini & Tiansu & Christina:


TODOS:

- Tornado plot and other results, including SARN & SARF & S
	- four panel plot for S or A, SARN or SARF
	- number of changes for SARN, SARF (part of bar plot figure)
- revisit Tornado plots, more types of clustering that are more structured than k-means (import matrix into Python, cluster different ways)
	- excel sheet of nearest gene to each peak in the clusters
- remove non-coding RNA detritus, reannotate the atlas with just RefSeq genes

- Diamond plots for A vs P, SA vs A, SAR vs SA
	- top 20, bottom 20 significant diff'ble expressed genes 

- motif analysis in the peaks that open at each step (HOMER?)
	- Non-redundant set of motifs, one per TF (Hyunwoo + Sagar + Han have the list)
		- enrichment of motifs found in differntial peaks versus whole atlas
	- restrict to TFs expressed in the celltype
	-
