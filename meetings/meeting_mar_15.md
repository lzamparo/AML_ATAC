Meeting 15 March
==================

Some confusion about whether the 'batch' covariate represents the days on which the runs were sequenced, or whether the libraries were prepared



Did since last time: 
====================
(done) Diamond plot in SAR vs P
	-  still looks as if ATAC & expression are not correlated
(done) Scatter plots contrasting ATAC changes versus expression changes 
	- A vs P / S vs P, SA vs A / SA vs S, SAR vs SA 
	- reinforces the diamond plot results; there is not a correlation between ATAC FC and expression FC



Still Todo from last time:
==========================

(1) Try clustering on tornado plots: 
	- First, super sized of plots: all conditions & peaks including both A & S
	- in tandem, look for the A-specific peaks from the differential accessibility data and do GSEA && pathway enrichment on these

    - Would like to figure out a way to do a track-style validation on the AvsP peaks that do not open further in SA (or diminish a bit)
	   - what's a good way to visualize the trajectory of these peaks?  Should I be looking at the library size corrected counts around the summits?

(2) Some clustering & visualizaton that captures the transient peaks along transition from P -> S -> A -> SA -> SAR -> ...
