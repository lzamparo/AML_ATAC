Meeting 25 January
==================

- Re-do the enrichments for SAR vs P tornado clusters, also A specific tornado cluster peaks
	- in tandem, look for the A-specific peaks from the differential accessibility data and do GSEA && pathway enrichment on these
- Tornado plot story for SAR vs P && P_A_SA_... plot: see some A-specific peaks that disappear and see other A vs P plots 
- Tornado plot story for SAR vs P && P_S_SA_... plot: see some S-specific peaks that disappear and see other S vs P plots 

- Would like to figure out a way to do a track-style validation on the AvsP peaks that do not open further in SA (or diminish a bit)
	- what's a good way to visualize the trajectory of these peaks?  Should I be looking at the library size corrected counts around the summits?
