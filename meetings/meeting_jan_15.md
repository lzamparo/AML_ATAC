Meeting Jan 15th
================


Tornado plot changes:
	[done] finer scale for tornados (10bp bins)
	[done] cap scale for tonado plots (re-scale so we see 0 - 100), and specify colour scheme
	- look at 'meta-peak' signal for each cluster and each condition

Transient vs stable DA peaks:
	- median fold change of expression versus median fold changes versus scatter plot
	[] C suggests looking at the set of differential peaks in A vs P (or S vs P) and track these peaks through each condition
	- C suggests a scatter plot of (S vs P logFC) versus (S vs A logFC) and (S vs P) versus (SA vs P) to see which sets of peaks are still open 
		when you get to SAR

Diamond plot changes:
	- 50 up, 50 down
	- grade the color of the peaks by log2FC



Overall need a clearer picture of what peak are contributing at which stage:

- look at sets of common open peaks through stages.  Start with changes from parental through to SA
- FIMO analysis -> Han, since he's a pro.
