Meeting Jan 15th

- median fold change of expression versus median fold changes versus scatter plot
- finer scale for tornados (10bp bins)
- cap scale for tonado plots (re-scale so we see 0 - 100), and specify colour scheme
- look at 'meta-peak' signal for each cluster and each condition

- C suggests looking at the set of differential peaks in A vs P (or S vs P) and track these peaks through each condition

- Diamond plots
	- grade the color of the peaks by log2FC

- Look at transient vs stable 


Overall need a clearer picture of what peak are contributing at which stage
- C suggests a scatter plot of (S vs P logFC) versus (S vs A logFC) and (S vs P) versus (SA vs P) to see which sets of peaks are still open 
when you get to SAR
- look at sets of common open peaks through stages.  Start with changes from parental through to SA

- FIMO analysis -> Han, since he's a pro.
