Meeting 27 February
==================

(Han will do) motif accessibility changes analysis: 
	- C sharing a figure that hints at what she means...
	- motifs within peaks in condiitions more vs less accessible: rank-sum test 

(1) Try clustering on tornado plots: 
	- First, super sized of plots: all conditions & peaks including both A & S
	- in tandem, look for the A-specific peaks from the differential accessibility data and do GSEA && pathway enrichment on these

- Would like to figure out a way to do a track-style validation on the AvsP peaks that do not open further in SA (or diminish a bit)
	- what's a good way to visualize the trajectory of these peaks?  Should I be looking at the library size corrected counts around the summits?

(2) Some clustering & visualizaton that captures the transient peaks along transition from P -> S -> A -> SA -> SAR -> ...

(done) Diamond plot in SAR vs P

(done) Scatter plots contrasting ATAC changes versus expression changes 
	- A vs P / S vs P, SA vs A / SA vs S, SAR vs SA
